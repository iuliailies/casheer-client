# casheer-client
This project serves as the user interface (UI) client for [Ozoniuss](https://github.com/Ozoniuss)'s [expense management app](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/casheer). Check out his repo for a more detailed description of the app's purpose.

This marks my first project in React, as I'm transitioning from an Angular background. I designed the UI mockups using Figma, and they can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/QGg3iCDPm1tXT2g9vQmrRW/Casheer?type=design&node-id=69%3A16&mode=design&t=unXU8wYjXywz7y4D-1).
